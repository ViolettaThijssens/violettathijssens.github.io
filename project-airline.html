                                    <li>Clear pricing: prices got users confused (totals and prices per passenger or fare type)Â </li>
                                    <li>Functions such as price lock flight, flex option, and save your price did not grab the attention of the participants, you had to prompt them to make them notice</li>

                        <p>I created flow diagrams to clarify the steps that the user and the system had to take for completing a booking. I started out with a common use case in Word.

                        <p>Next, I moved to Lucid chart to build a flow covering all cases &mdash; from the happy path to the worst-case scenario. I drew lines in Photoshop in this complex flow chart to highlight specific use cases, e.g., the happy path.

                            <li>The form on the homepage to select search criteria for a flight should not be treated as linear. Users could fill in the fields in different orders
                            </li>
                            <li>Users had to have edit functionality on every page and had to be able to alter selections on a previous page easily

                        <p>The flow diagrams gave me a way to follow use cases through the booking process. I could quickly check the flow diagrams to add options for editing selections or build in different paths, e.g., one-way or return trips.

                        <p>I ensured that navigation, visual design and typography adhered to accessibility rules. I ran colour checkers on the pages, made sure font size was readable and considered navigation routes with clicking, typing and tabbing. Furthermore,
                            I ensured that elements could be identified in at least two ways, e.g., seating got a colour and icon code.

                        <p>Clear communication about the rules and the content of the elements in the booking process to others is important. That's why I paid attention to create hand-off documentation. I made one hand-off in InVision and another in Axure
                            to get to know the possibilities of both platforms.

                        <p>Furthermore, I made a sticker sheet with all design elements and their variations. For example, I put on the sticker sheet a section on flights with the different kinds of flights (direct, indirect, cheapest, and fastest).

                        <p>If the airline had been a real client, I would also have built or contributed to a design library. This would make it easier for the client to expand or change elements in line with previous work.
